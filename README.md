> Aug 6, 2023: MacDriver is getting majorly overhauled and expanded on! Currently development is happening in the [darwinkit branch](https://github.com/progrium/macdriver/tree/darwinkit) and we're working towards a [preview release](https://github.com/progrium/macdriver/issues/167) in the next couple weeks before switching over.

------

MacDriver is a toolkit for working with Apple/Mac APIs and frameworks in Go. It currently has 2 parts:

## 1. Bindings for Objective-C
The `objc` package wraps the [Objective-C runtime](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime?language=objc) to dynamically interact with Objective-C objects and classes:

```go
cls := objc.NewClass("AppDelegate", "NSObject")
cls.AddMethod("applicationDidFinishLaunching:", func(app objc.Object) {
	fmt.Println("Launched!")
})
objc.RegisterClass(cls)

delegate := objc.Get("AppDelegate").Alloc().Init()
app := objc.Get("NSApplication").Get("sharedApplication")
app.Set("delegate:", delegate)
app.Send("run")
```

* Access any class or method you can access in Objective-C
* Common object convenience methods: Get, Set, Alloc, Init, ...
* Create and extend classes at runtime that can be used by Objective-C code
* Retain and Release methods for working with Objective-C memory management

## 2. Framework Packages
The `cocoa`, `webkit`, and `core` packages wrap `objc` with wrapper types for parts of the Apple/Mac APIs. They're being added to as needed by hand until
we can automate this process with schema data. These packages effectively let you use Apple APIs as if they were native Go libraries, letting
you write Mac applications (potentially also iOS, watchOS, etc) as Go applications:

```go
func main() {
	app := cocoa.NSApp_WithDidLaunch(func(notification objc.Object) {
		config := webkit.WKWebViewConfiguration_New()
		wv := webkit.WKWebView_Init(core.Rect(0, 0, 1440, 900), config)
		url := core.URL("http://progrium.com")
		req := core.NSURLRequest_Init(url)
		wv.LoadRequest(req)

		w := cocoa.NSWindow_Init(core.Rect(0, 0, 1440, 900),
			cocoa.NSClosableWindowMask|
				cocoa.NSTitledWindowMask,
			cocoa.NSBackingStoreBuffered, false)
		w.SetContentView(wv)
		w.MakeKeyAndOrderFront(w)
		w.Center()
	})
	app.SetActivationPolicy(cocoa.NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular)
	app.ActivateIgnoringOtherApps(true)
	app.Run()
}
```

* 1:1 mapping of API names with Objective-C APIs
* Cocoa types: NSApplication, NSImage, NSMenu, NSWindow, more ...
* Webkit types: WKWebView and configuration classes
* Core types: NSData, NSDictionary, NSNumber, NSPoint, NSRect, NSSize, NSString, NSURL, more ...
* Core also allows dispatching Go functions in the Cocoa run loop
* Many constants/enums are defined

#### Generating wrappers

Eventually we can generate most of the wrapper APIs using bridgesupport and/or doc schemas. However, the number of APIs
is pretty ridiculous so there are lots of edge cases I wouldn't know how to automate yet. We can just continue to create them by hand
as needed until we have enough coverage/confidence to know how we'd generate wrappers.

## Thanks

The original `objc` and `variadic` packages were written by [Mikkel Krautz](https://github.com/mkrautz). The `variadic` package is some assembly magic to make everything possible since libobjc relies heavily on variadic function calls, which aren't possible out of the box in Cgo.
