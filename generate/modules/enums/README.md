This directory contains value dumps of enums and constants generated by running:

```
go run ./generate/tools/enumexport.go
```

This will iterate over modules defined in the `modules` package and write code 
to print values for enums and constants that are either integers, strings, or
floats. This is a separate process from bindings code generation and should be 
done when a new framework is added. 

It should ideally be done on a x86 Mac running the latest version of macOS so 
it can capture all possible values. Files suffixed with _arm64 are produced by
hand by running enumexport for each framework on an arm Mac, then diffing against
the base x86 version of the file. They should only include the constants that
are different on arm.

This data is used by code generation as a raw repository of values to create 
Go code for constants and enums.
